Here is a basic Go unit testing example that tests the `saveVote` function:

 ```go
package main

import (
  "testing"
)

type MockStorage struct{}

func (*MockStorage) Save(key string, value int64) error { return nil }

func TestSaveVote(t *testing.T) {
  var mockStorage MockStorage

  if err := saveVote(&mockStorage, Vote{}); err!= nil {
    t.Errorf("Expected no errors but got %v", err)
  }
}
```
In this example, we create a new instance of our mocked storage implementation and pass it to the `saveVote` function under test. We then assert that there were no errors returned from the call by using the `t.Error()` method.
